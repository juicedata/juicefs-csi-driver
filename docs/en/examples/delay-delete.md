# How to delay delete mount pod

> Supported Versions: >=v0.13.0

JuiceFS CSI driver deletes mount pod immediately when no application pod is using it.
But at some point you may want the mount pod to be deleted lazily.
If there are new application pods using the same volume in a short period of time,
it is expected that the mount pod will not be destroyed and rebuilt, causing unnecessary waste of resources.

This document shows how to set the delay deletion duration for mount pods.

## Static provisioning

You can configure the length of time of delay deletion in PV. Set `juicefs/mount-delete-delay` in `volumeAttributes`, the value is the duration to be set. As follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: juicefs-pv
  labels:
    juicefs-name: ten-pb-fs
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Pi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  csi:
    driver: csi.juicefs.com
    volumeHandle: test-bucket
    fsType: juicefs
    nodePublishSecretRef:
      name: juicefs-secret
      namespace: default
    volumeAttributes:
      juicefs/mount-delete-delay: 1m
```

Where, the unit can be: "ns" (nanoseconds), "us" (microseconds), "ms" (milliseconds), "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

When the last application pod is deleted, the mount pod is marked with the `juicefs-delete-at` annotation to record the moment when it should be deleted.
When the deletion time is reached, the mount pod will be deleted. When a new application Pod uses the same JuiceFS Volume,
the annotation `juicefs-delete-at` will be deleted.

Apply PVC and sample pod as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: juicefs-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  storageClassName: ""
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Pi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      juicefs-name: ten-pb-fs
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: juicefs-app-mount-options
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - args:
        - -c
        - while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /data/out.txt; sleep 5; done
      command:
        - /bin/sh
      image: centos
      name: app
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: data
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 10m
  volumes:
    - name: data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: juicefs-pvc
```

## Dynamic provisioning

You can configure the length of time of delay deletion in StorageClass. Set `juicefs/mount-delete-delay` in `parameters`, the value is the duration to be set. As follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: juicefs-sc
  namespace: default
provisioner: csi.juicefs.com
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-name: juicefs-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/provisioner-secret-namespace: default
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-name: juicefs-secret
  csi.storage.k8s.io/node-publish-secret-namespace: default
  juicefs/mount-delete-delay: 1m
```

Apply PVC and sample pod as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: juicefs-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Pi
  storageClassName: juicefs-sc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: juicefs-app-mount-options
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - args:
        - -c
        - while true; do echo $(date -u) >> /data/out.txt; sleep 5; done
      command:
        - /bin/sh
      image: centos
      name: app
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: juicefs-pv
  volumes:
    - name: juicefs-pv
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: juicefs-pvc
```
